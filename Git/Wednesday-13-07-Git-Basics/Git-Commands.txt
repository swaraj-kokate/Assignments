Day 2 - Git Basics

It is a good idea to introduce yourself to Git with your name and public email address before doing any operation. The easiest way to do so is:

1) For configuring User Name :
git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"

2) For configuring User Email : 
git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com

3) Create and open a Folder :
a) Create Folder
mkdir Folder_Name
b) Open Folder
cd Folder_Name

4) Initialize working directory to repository :
git init 
Note : you may notice a new directory created, named ".git".

5) Create a text file :
touch File_Name (for example,touch F1.txt)

6) Open the created fie in notepad :
notepad File_Name
note : If the command is giving an error then use Start File_Name

7) To know the state of working directory :
git status

8) Next, tell Git to take a snapshot of the contents of all files under the current directory (note the .)
git add . (for current file)
Note : For specific file use git add File_Name  

9) This snapshot is now stored in a temporary staging area which Git calls the "index". You can permanently store the contents of the index in the repository with :
git commit -m "Message" (-m in here is for the message)

Youâ€™ve now stored the first version of your project in Git.
10) Check the state of working directory :
git status

11) In order to check all the commits in a repository's history :
git log
